    "When I'm asked for a quick, easy introduction to combinatorics, I often refer to Gian-Carlo Rota's 'Twelvefold Way' (popularized by Richard Stanley's *Enumerative Combinatorics*). The Twelvefold Way is a systematic classification of 12 related combinatorial problems, organized in a table with 12 entries based on restrictions on the number and the color of balls in urns.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when I am faced with a similar question targeting elementary number theory, I can't point to anything comparable. \n",
    "Writing something similar to the TW was one of my motivations for this notebook. It was obvious to choose the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic as the starting point. Here we introduce 11 predicates that describe natural numbers solely in terms of their prime factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve a systematic representation, we will ensure that these predicates are mutually orthogonal. Thereby, every natural number is an element of precisely one of the 12 classes, and the union of these classes will encompass all natural numbers. This representation can then be clearly displayed as a binary tree. Interestingly, of the 23 nodes of this tree, 10 were added to OEIS only in the last 10 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we introduce the concept of factorization for all integers $ n \\geq 0 $ and will adopt a fundamentally different primary classification than the one commonly used in the OEIS."
