# Dedekind's "Zweite Definition des Endlichen und Unendlichen."

The text is from
https://github.com/DavidMichaelRoberts/Dedekind_2nd_def

I made some, but only small changes in the text.

But the TeX layout is different (I try to keep the page
geometry of the original und put all comments in the margins).

It is an experiment just for fun. It only consists of the first 
three pages of the text and I have no intention of taking the 
editing any further.
