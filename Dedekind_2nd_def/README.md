# Dedekind's "Zweite Definition des Endlichen und Unendlichen."

This is a fork of

        https://github.com/DavidMichaelRoberts/Dedekind_2nd_def

There are some, but only small changes in the text.

The purpose of the project is to explore writing a bilingual TeX-ted text.<br> 
And to get to know Dedekind a little better, of course.<br>  
Everything is public domain, of course.
