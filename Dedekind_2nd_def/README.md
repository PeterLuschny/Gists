# Dedekind's "Zweite Definition des Endlichen und Unendlichen."

This is a fork of

        https://github.com/DavidMichaelRoberts/Dedekind_2nd_def

There are some, but only very small changes in the text.
But the TeX layout is different.

There are two versions:

   * The English translation of D. M. Roberts reformatted. <br>
   It only consists of the first 3 pages. I tried to keep 
   the page geometry of the original and put the comments 
   in the margins.
   
   * A bilingual version. <br>
   Again only the first three pages and again I tried to keep 
   the page geometry of the original. <br>

The purpose of the project was to explore the possibilities and 
difficulties of a bilingual TeX-text. <br> And to get to know 
Dedekind a little better, of course. 

I have no intention of taking the project any further. Everything 
is public domain, of course.
