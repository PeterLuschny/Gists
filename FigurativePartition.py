                          FIGURATIVE PARTITIONS

We study decreasing index paths in two-dimensional arrays that sum up to a given 
total t if evaluated by a generating function A. The arrays are denoted by A(n, k) 
for n >= 0 and k >= 0. A path is a list of index pairs W = [i_0, i_1, ..., i_m] 
where the index pairs i_j = (n_j, k_j) are subject to the condition 

       'n_j > n_{j+1} and k_j >  k_{j+1}' (case A385900), 
    or 'n_j > n_{j+1} and k_j >= k_{j+1}' (case A385901).

The values of the generating function A sum to a prescribed positive number 
t = Sum_{(n, k) in W} A(n, k). We call n the 'color' and k the 'shade' of A(n, k).

Here we consider the array A139600 with the generating function

    P(n, k) = k + n * (k - 1) * k / 2 for n >= 0, k >= 2,

supplemented by the condition P(n, 1) = 1 if n = 0 otherwise 0.

The array starts with the first row being the nonnegative integers, then 
triangular numbers, squares, pentagonal, etc., the columns begin at k = 2, 
and the case k = 1 is treated as an exceptional case.

We call F = [(i, j) in W: P(i, j)] a 'figurative partition of n' if Sum(F) = n. 
In the context of figurative partitions, we call n the 'shape' and k the 'size' 
of P(n, k). (See also the plots of Stefan Friedrich Birkner at 
https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Peter_Luschny/FigurateNumber.)

For example, in the case A385900 (strictly descending) the path 
W = [(3, 4), (2, 2), (0, 1)] leads to F = 22 + 4 + 1, which is a figurative 
partition of 27. In other words, 27 has a figurative layout on a counting board 
with a pentagon of size 4, a square of size 2, and a 'pebble', the unique 
figurative partition of 1. Another figurative partition of 27 is an octagon of 
size 3, a pentagon of size 2, plus a pebble.

In the weakly descending case A385901, some examples for figurative partitions 
of 27 are, in the format '(shape, size) value':

    (6, 3) 21 + (2, 2) 4 + (0, 2) 2;
    (5, 3) 18 + (3, 2) 5 + (1, 2) 3 + (0, 1) 1;
    (5, 3) 18 + (1, 3) 6 + (0, 3) 3;
    (4, 3) 15 + (3, 2) 5 + (2, 2) 4 + (1, 2) 3.

The question: given a positive integer n, how many figurative partitions of n exist?

"""
I asked ChatGPT to give a  **Summary**  of the above, and it answered:

This work studies *figurative partitions* of a positive integer `n` using paths 
through a 2D array `A(n, k)` defined by a generating function `P(n, k)`. 
A figurative partition of `n` is a sequence of index pairs `(n, k)` such that the 
sum of `P` values along a path equals `n`. Paths must follow either strictly 
decreasing (`A385900`) or weakly decreasing (`A385901`) index rules. The function
`P(n, k)` generates figurate numbers (e.g., triangular, square, pentagonal) based 
on `n` (the shape of the figure) and `k` (the size of the figure). The code generates
all valid figurative partitions of `n` via depth-first search over eligible `(n, k)`
pairs, and returns their count or full list. This results in a combinatorial inter-
pretation of `n` as a sum of figurate numbers under specific structural constraints.
