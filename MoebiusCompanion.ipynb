    "So, let me explain my discomfort. For me, the concept of a divisor implies that it is part of a reference quantity in some way. Since the referenced quantity here is a natural number n, n can only have a finite number of divisors: the divisors have to be a subset of {0, 1, 2,..., n}. However, this is not the case with the above definition because that implies that 0 has infinitely many divisors.<br>\n",
